# A. If NodeJS is installed on the machine:
  * For Linux/MacOS: 
    1. This is already a proper executable script
       if "executable" file-permission is added to the the file and can be run with
       ```
       $ ./plusone.js --digit=10
       ```
    2. A Shell script can be created that executes it - `plusone.sh`.
       The creation is of the SH file is like one that's auto generated by NPM
       when installing the local package globally as in point-III, just the paths inside are different
  * For Windows:
    1. Create a BAT or CMD file plusone.bat/plusone.cmd and run it with:
       ```
       $ plusone --digit=10
       ```
       The creation is of the CMD file is like one that's auto generated by NPM
       when installing the local package globally as in point-III, just the paths inside are different
  * For all using the npm packaging:
     Add a "bin" property in the "package.json" file, like:
     ```console
     {..., "bin": {"plusone": "./plusone.js"} }
     ```
     Then install the local package globally with:
     ```
     $ npm install -g .
     ```
     Now there will be executables "plusone" for both Linux/MacOS and Windows,
     e.g NPM will automatically create such SH and CMD scripts and put it in the global NPM folder,
     so finally it can be run with:
     ```
     $ plusone --digit=10
     ```

# B. If NodeJS is not installed:
  * For all systems a "packager" can be used that will create proper executable bundles for all.
     A good one is 'pkg', so install it and then package:
     ```
     $ npm install -g pkg
     $ pkg plusone.js
     ```
     This will generate 'plusone-linux' ,'plusone-macos' and 'plusone-win.exe' executable files, so run it with:
     ```
     $ plusone-win --digit=10
     ```
